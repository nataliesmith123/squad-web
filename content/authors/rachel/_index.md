Rachel is a fifth-year doctoral candidate in Human Biology. Her research examines the impact of social determinants of health, historical and intergenerational trauma and resilience on contemporary health for Native American and Alaska Native peoples. Her dissertation research seeks to elucidate and document the pathways through which a family history of Federal Indian Boarding School attendance may continue to impact the physical health and wellbeing of future generations, as well as the ways in which engagement in cultural revitalization activities may mitigate the impacts of historical trauma.
