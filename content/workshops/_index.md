### Background
In 2021, we used the empirical evidence from our review to inform the development of interactive workshop for a range of audiences, which covers the theoretical considerations of race and ethnicity in health research, tools for communication, and highlights opportunities for improvement at the individual level. 

The four-hour workshop was designed to help participants of all training levels and of different health disciplines develop skills to thoughtfully communicate the use of race and ethnicity in their work. Workshops involved a combination of lecture and small group activities. Workshops highlight current cross-disciplinary practices in how race and ethnicity are communicated in published manuscripts, common poor practices (i.e., ambiguous or outright harmful language), “best practices”, and the changes participants can make in their own scholarship. 

Attendees are also provided with a 30 page “resource packet” developed by the team, with readings, guidelines, and other materials for more thoughtful and clear communication of race and ethnicity in their research.

Learning Objectives: 
1. Identify the harms of biological determinism and the ways in which language used by researchers reflects and perpetuates those ideas.
2. Understand how to effectively communicate the definitions, coding, and measurement of race and ethnicity in their health scholarship.
3. Identify ambiguous language surrounding scientific communication of definitions, coding, and measurement of race and ethnicity health scholarship.
4. Thoughtfully critique and provide feedback on conceptualization, measurement, analysis, and interpretation for race and ethnicity in the peer review process.
