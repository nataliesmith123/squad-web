Nafeesa Andrabi (she/her) is currently a Sociology PhD student at UNC Chapel Hill. She integrates multidisciplinary theoretical and methodological approaches to understand health disparities and experiences of race and Muslimness in the US. First, she focuses on American Muslims and perceived Muslimness as a site for understanding how religion, immigration, colonization and language shape racial identity formation and the US racial order. Second, she examines the consequences of Muslimness and race on health across the life course, situating Muslim health outcomes within the discourse on health disparities more broadly. Lastly, she is interested in theorizing on the experiences of those who exist on the fringes of US racial categories. Nafeesaâ€™s work has been supported by the Biosocial NIH T32 Training Program at the Carolina Population Center. She is also a recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Nafeesa graduated with Honors from Occidental College with a B.A. in Sociology in 2014.
