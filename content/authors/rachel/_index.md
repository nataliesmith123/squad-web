Rachel Wilbur (descendant Tolowa, Chetco) is a human biologist whose work examines the impact of social determinants of health, historical and intergenerational trauma, and resilience on contemporary health for American Indian and Alaska Native peoples. She is particularly interested in using community-based participatory research methods to explore ways in which cultural revitalization may mitigate the health impacts of historical trauma events. She is currently a postdoctoral research fellow in Indigenous community well-being at Harvard Medical School, and is a Harvard University Native American Program scholar.
