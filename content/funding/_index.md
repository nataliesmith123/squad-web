### This project would not have been possible without the support of many people and resources

We are grateful to the Carolina Population Center for training support (T32 HD091058) and for general support (P2C HD050924). 


Our project has also received generous funding from the UNC Department of Sociology, awarded to Andi Goodwin and Nafeesa Andrabi.
